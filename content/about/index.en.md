## Hello!

I'm Muhammed Ali Subaşı, I graduated from Samsun University as a Meteorological Engineer and I'm moving towards my career goals. Combining my curiosity in the world of technology and software with the science of meteorology, I am dedicated to continuous innovation and development.

I have developed my data science and analytical skills on large meteorological datasets, working to understand complex weather patterns and discover important trends. In the process, I have mastered data visualization, increasing my ability to effectively present complex data. I mainly work on Python programming language and have in-depth knowledge of many libraries such as matplotlib, xarray, requests.

## My Goals

My goals include going further in the field of software development and integrating new technologies. I also strive to continuously educate and develop myself to deepen my knowledge in meteorology and atmospheric sciences and become a leading expert in this field.

I aim not only to improve my knowledge and skills, but also to contribute to the community by sharing this knowledge with others. Adopting an open approach to learning in every project I do not only contributes to my own development, but also benefits those around me.

## Contact and Follow-up

In the next steps of my career, I am eagerly working on groundbreaking projects in both meteorological science and software development to make a positive impact on the world.

For more information and details about my projects, you can follow my blog and social media accounts.

Thank you!
